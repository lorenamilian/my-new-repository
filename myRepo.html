          <h2>Css Transitions</h2>
          <p>
            Css transitions alow you to change the style, position or both to a
            css element in this example ( transition: opacity .3s ease-out ..2s;
            ) I'm using the short cut to create a transition to the opacity
            property, with a duration of .3s, I used the timeing function to
            specify the speed curve of the animation and the transition delay to
            set a time delay value for the all transition to happen!!

          <h2>Css Transform</h2>
          <p>
            The transform property applies a 2D or 3D transformation to an
            element. This property allows you to rotate, scale, move, skew,
            etc., elements. The translate function for example move somthing
            from one place to another. Rotate as the word indicate rotate an
            element, the defoult point to rotate is the center, but you can
            expecify the exact refernce point form you want to rotate, for
            exapmle transform-origing(0 0) will rotate the imag fom the top left
            corner and rotate(100% 100%) will do it for the rigth bottom corner!
            <br />
            img: hover{<br />
            transform: rotate(-5deg) scale(1.1);<br />
            }
