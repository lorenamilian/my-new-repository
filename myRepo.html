          <h2>Css Transitions</h2>
          <p>
            Css transitions alow you to change the style, position or both to a
            css element in this example ( transition: opacity .3s ease-out ..2s;
            ) I'm using the short cut to create a transition to the opacity
            property, with a duration of .3s, I used the timeing function to
            specify the speed curve of the animation and the transition delay to
            set a time delay value for the all transition to happen!!

          <h2>Css Transform</h2>
          <p>
            The transform property applies a 2D or 3D transformation to an
            element. This property allows you to rotate, scale, move, skew,
            etc., elements. The translate function for example move somthing
            from one place to another. Rotate as the word indicate rotate an
            element, the defoult point to rotate is the center, but you can
            expecify the exact refernce point form you want to rotate, for
            exapmle transform-origing(0 0) will rotate the imag fom the top left
            corner and rotate(100% 100%) will do it for the rigth bottom corner!

            <h2>Data Structures(Computer Scince)</h2>
            <p>
              Today I've learn about data structure how can influence the run
              time of an algorithm or how the implementation of an algotithm can
              defer on the data stucture being used. <br />
              <strong>What is Data Structure:</strong> It's the collection of
              values and the format that they are stored in. The relationship
              between the values in the collection as well as the operations
              applied on the data store. <br />
              JavaScript has an "Heterogeneous Structure" can accept string,
              numbers, boolean in the same array. <br />
              <strong>Non Contiguous Data Structure :</strong> The structure
              stores the values as well as the refernce to where the next value
              is (that refernce is call pointer to the next block of memory )
              <i> this increase the run time of commun operations.</i>

              <h2>Algorithmic Thinking</h2>
              <p>
                <strong> Algorithm:</strong> Its a series of steps or
                instuctions for completing a task. In
                <i>Computer Programming</i>its the series of steps a program
                takes finish certain task. <br />
                <strong>what to do:</strong><br />
                1-
                <i>Clearly defien the the problemstatment, input and output.</i>
                <br />
                2-Steps in a very specific order. | differents <br />
                3-Shoud produce a result. <br />
                4-Should be completedin a finete amount of time. <br />
                <br />
                <strong>Efficiency of an algorithm:</strong> <br />
                Its determind by the TIME COMPLEXITY (Measure by the amount of
                time takes the program to compleate the task in relation with
                the size of the data) and SPACE COMPLEXITY is a measure of the
                amount of memory an algorithm needs. <br />
                <strong>Big O </strong> Its the theorical definition of the
                complexity of an algorithm as a function of the size. Examples
                of runtime(constant, linear, logarithmic, cuadratic). <br />
                <strong>
                  Binary Search has a logarithmic time and constant
                  Space</strong

              <h2>CSS Flexbox Layout</h2>
              <p>
                Flexbox allows us to create resposive web design realy easy.
                Create a multi-comlumn layout, a side nav-bar that change from
                display horizontaly to verticaly and much more are the stuff I
                can make with Flexbox.
                <br />
                <strong
                  >Flexbox Container ( display: flex; | flex-direction: column;
                  | flex-wrap: wrap; | justify-content: space-between; |
                  align-items: center; ) </strong
                ><br />
                Set the conext for the flexbox layout, contain flex items, the
                actual elements you are going to layout using flexbox.
                <br />
                <strong>Flexbox items</strong><br />
                It's every direct child of the flex container.
